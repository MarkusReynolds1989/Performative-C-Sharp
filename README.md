# Performative C# 
Repository for an upcoming a Pearson published course on performative C#.

You will need:
.Net 7 - Compiling the .Net code, running the tests
Rustup Nightly - Compiling the Rust code   
C/C++ package manager. I highly recommend vcpkg.

I also highly recommend you have some way to investigate the IL code that is generated by .NET.   
It also wouldn't hurt to find out how to use a tool like godbolt.org to take a look at how the actual native code for Rust is turning out. You can also use it on the C# code but it probably won't give the full picture.
